            <h4>Requirements</h4>
          </blockquote>
          <div class="fs-6 fw-bold mb-2">NodeJS</div>
          <p>Make sure you have a recent version (14 or later) of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node</a> installed globally.</p>
          <p>We recommend installing Node and Watchman using <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew.</a> Run the following commands in a Terminal after installing Homebrew:</p>
          <p>brew install node<br/>brew install watchman</p>
          <p>If you have already installed Node on your system, make sure it is Node 14 or newer.</p>
          <br />

          <h5 class="fw-normal mb-2">For IOS View</h5>
          <div class="fs-6 fw-bold mb-2">Ruby</div>
          <p><a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_blank">Ruby</a> is a general-purpose programming language. React Native uses in some scripts related to the iOS dependency management. As every programming language, there are different versions of Ruby that have been developed during the years.</p>
          <p>React Native uses a .ruby-version file to make sure that your version of Ruby is aligned with what is needed. Currently, macOS 13.2 is shipped with Ruby 2.6.10, which is not what is required by this version of React Native (2.7.6). Our suggestion is to install a Ruby version manager and to install the proper version of Ruby in your system.</p>
          <p>Some common Ruby version manager are:</p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv" target="_blank">rbenv</a><br />
            <a href="https://rvm.io/" target="_blank">RVM</a><br />
            <a href="https://github.com/postmodern/chruby" target="_blank">chruby</a><br />
            <a href="https://github.com/asdf-vm" target="_blank">asdf-vm</a> with the <a href="https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-ruby" target="_blank">asdf-ruby</a> plugin
          </p>
          <p>To check what is your current version of Ruby, you can run this command:<br />ruby --version</p>
          <p>This project needs 2.7.6 ruby version.</p>

          <div class="fs-6 fw-bold mb-2">Xcode & CocoaPods</div>
          <p>The easiest way to install Xcode is via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12" target="_blank">Mac App Store.</a> Installing Xcode will also install the iOS Simulator and all the necessary tools to build your iOS app.</p>
          <p>If you have already installed Xcode on your system, make sure it is version 10 or newer.</p>
          <div class="fs-6 fw-normal mb-2">Command Line Tools</div>
          <p>You will also need to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. Open Xcode, then choose "Preferences..." from the Xcode menu. Go to the Locations panel and install the tools by selecting the most recent version in the Command Line Tools dropdown.</p>
          <i class="fw-500">Installing an iOS Simulator in Xcode</i>
          <p>To install a simulator, open <b>Xcode > Preferences…</b> and select the <b>Components</b> tab. Select a simulator with the corresponding version of iOS you wish to use.</p>
          <i class="fw-500">CocoaPods</i>
          <p>
            <a href="https://cocoapods.org/" target="_blank">CocoaPods</a> is one of the dependency management system available for iOS. It is built with Ruby and you can install it using the version of Ruby you configured with in the previous steps.
          </p>

          <h5 class="fw-normal mb-2">For Android View</h5>
          <div class="fs-6 fw-bold mb-2">Java Development Kit</div>
          <p>We recommend installing the OpenJDK distribution called Azul Zulu using <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew.</a> Run the following commands in a Terminal after installing Homebrew:</p>
          <p>brew tap homebrew/cask-versions<br />
          brew install --cask zulu11</p>
          <p>The Zulu OpenJDK distribution offers JDKs for both Intel and M1 Macs. This will make sure your builds are faster on M1 Macs compared to using an Intel-based JDK.</p>
          <p class="mb-4">If you have already installed JDK on your system, we recommend JDK 11. You may encounter problems using higher JDK versions.</p>
          <div class="fs-6 fw-bold mb-2">Android development environment</div>
          <p>please make sure to carefully follow the next few steps.</p>

          <i class="fw-500">1. Install Android Studio</i>
          <p class="mt-2">Download and <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio" target="_blank">install Android Studio.</a> While on Android Studio installation wizard, make sure the boxes next to all of the following items are checked:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Android SDK</li>
            <li>Android SDK Platform</li>
            <li>Android Virtual Device</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Then, click "Next" to install all of these components.</p>
          <p>Once setup has finalized and you're presented with the Welcome screen, proceed to the next step.</p>

          <i class="fw-500">2. Install the Android SDK</i>
          <p class="mt-2">Android Studio installs the latest Android SDK by default. Building a React Native app with native code, however, requires the Android 13 (Tiramisu) SDK in particular. Additional Android SDKs can be installed through the SDK Manager in Android Studio.<br />To do that, open Android Studio, click on "More Actions" button and select "SDK Manager".</p>
          <img src="./assets/images/android-wlc.png" class="img-fluid"/>
          <p>Select the "SDK Platforms" tab from within the SDK Manager, then check the box next to "Show Package Details" in the bottom right corner. Look for and expand the Android 13 (Tiramisu) entry, then make sure the following items are checked:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Android SDK Platform 33</li>
            <li>Intel x86 Atom_64 System Image or Google APIs Intel x86 Atom System Image or (for Apple M1 Silicon) Google APIs ARM 64 v8a System Image</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Next, select the "SDK Tools" tab and check the box next to "Show Package Details" here as well. Look for and expand the "Android SDK Build-Tools" entry, then make sure that 33.0.0 is selected.</p>
          <p>Finally, click "Apply" to download and install the Android SDK and related build tools.</p>

          <i class="fw-500">3. Configure the ANDROID_HOME environment variable</i>
          <p class="mt-2">The React Native tools require some environment variables to be set up in order to build apps with native code.</p>
          <p>Add the following lines to your ~/.zprofile or ~/.zshrc (if you are using bash, then ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc) config file:

          </p>
          <p>
            export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk<br />
            export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator<br />
            export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
          </p>
          <p>Run source ~/.zprofile (or source ~/.bash_profile for bash) to load the config into your current shell. Verify that ANDROID_HOME has been set by running echo $ANDROID_HOME and the appropriate directories have been added to your path by running echo $PATH.</p>
          <div class="fs-6 fw-bold mt-3 mb-2">React Native Command Line Interface</div>
          <p>React Native has a built-in command line interface. Rather than install and manage a specific version of the CLI globally, we recommend you access the current version at runtime using npx, which ships with Node.js. With npx react-native <command>, the current stable version of the CLI will be downloaded and executed at the time the command is run.</p>

          <p>As part of the architecture we have included the use of GraphQL as a complement for backend operations.</p>
          <p>GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.</p>
